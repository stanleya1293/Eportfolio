                <p> Hi there! I would love for you to get to know me better! My name is Arden Stanley.
                    I am a third year undergraduate student at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga 
                    majoring in computer science: software and systems.  I am also pursuing a minor in mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal in life is to innovate to provide a better future for all humans! 
                    I am incredibly passionate about programming, mathematics, physics, and electronics,
                    amongst other STEM fields which I find very interesting.  Throughout my life,
                    I have prided myself upon spending time immersed in learning, building, and 
                    furthering my experiences and knowledge of anything that I can.  I am very excited
                    for the fact that soon, I will be able to apply my knowledge in ways that benefit
                    the progression of society.  
                </p>
                <p>    
                    My primary fields on interest are computer graphics, 
                    application development, compiler design, OS design, firmware engineering, and
                    really anything else relating to systems programming!  I also enjoy learning about
                    AI/ML and would love to one day take part in developing this cutting edge technology.
                    I am currently seeking internships and job oppurtunities in these areas!
                </p>
